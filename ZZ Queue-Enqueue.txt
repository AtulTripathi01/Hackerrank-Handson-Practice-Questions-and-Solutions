ZZ Queue-Enqueue


Write a program to create a queue of size N specified by the user. Then you will be given an K value. K value represents the no.of elements to be inserted into the queue. After completion of insertion process print the element from starting of the queue to ending of the queue.

Input Format

First line contains N value

Second line contains K value followed by K no.of elements

Constraints

1<=N<=100

1<=K<=100

1<=element<=1000

Output Format

if N

else print the elements in the queue.

Sample Input 0

5
3
1
2
3
Sample Output 0

1 2 3
Explanation 0

We have to define the queue of size "5" and we have to insert "3" elements in it.

1 will be inserted into the queue first. Then on top of "1", "2" will be inserted and on top of "2" ,"3" will be inserted

Now we have to print the elements from starting of the queue to ending of the queue

using namespace std;


int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int a [n];
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    {
        cout << a[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
